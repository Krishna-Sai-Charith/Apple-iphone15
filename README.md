# Apple iPhone 15 Landing Page

# Introduction:

In this project, I set out to recreate the Apple iPhone 15 Pro website using React, Tailwind CSS, and cutting-edge technologies like GSAP animations, Three.js 3D effects, and Sentry for error monitoring. React provided a solid foundation for building dynamic user interfaces, while Tailwind CSS facilitated rapid prototyping and styling. Integrating GSAP animations enhanced user interaction with seamless custom animations, creating a visually engaging experience. Additionally, Three.js enabled the incorporation of lifelike animated 3D models of the iPhone 15 Pro, elevating the website's immersive quality. Sentry integration ensured real-time error monitoring, enhancing the website's stability and reliability.

# What I Have Learned:

This project was a journey of learning and discovery, encompassing various aspects of modern web development. I explored advanced animation techniques with GSAP, deepening my understanding of creating seamless custom animations. Delving into Three.js, I faced challenges understanding 3D rendering but ultimately gained proficiency in creating scenes, working with geometries and materials, and optimizing performance. Handling challenges in Three.js, such as managing complex scenes and ensuring compatibility, honed my troubleshooting skills. Integrating Sentry introduced me to real-time error monitoring, emphasizing the importance of proactive issue resolution for website stability. Overall, this project expanded my skill set and confidence in leveraging cutting-edge technologies for dynamic web experiences.
